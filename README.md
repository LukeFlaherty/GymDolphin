Using the MERN stack
- Mongo DB
- Express JS
- React JS
- Node JS

Created a fitness tracker that has a complete backend that allows users to create exercises that they do and how frequent they do them.

Express as the lightweight backend framework it is, allowed for a streamlined process for creating the back end.

MongoDB Atlas provided a great quick and easy to implement DataBase service for this project.
Allowed for easy data manipulation due to its auto generation of unique data keys.

Used Insomnia to follow Software Development Principles of testing.
- used to test the API POST and GET requests

Followed CRUD principles on the exercise portion of the database allowing Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Used React Router to navigate to different pages and keep consistant React Principles by having each page and url be its own component.

Bootstrap Styling for the whole App, used no custom CSS.

Using Axios Library to send http requests to the backend.
- Must update the post location if you were hosting

Used JS Promises for a lot of the database fetching.
